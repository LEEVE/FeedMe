FeedMe is a web app that aims to enables users to order food from any restaurant. In addition, users are able to become delivery drivers that earn money through each successful delivery.  This idea was formed due to the limited amount of delivery options for numerous restaurants across Melbourne. After conducting research, it was discovered that the main cause for this is the heavy cost of restaurants to have delivery drivers and services in place. As a result, they remain lackluster. By creating a self sustaining delivery driver force (users becoming drivers, similar to Uber), we established early on that FeedMe would ideally make the delivery of restaurant food more efficient and accessible to people in Melbourne and all over Australia.
